title: Translations
---

Translations are managed by [Weblate][2] on a repository which is hosted on [bitbucket][1]. This repository is
a subtree located at the `/translations/` path within this repository.

## Workflow
The workflow described is part of the build configuration.

1. The developer use a string into the code defining a [default value][3] according to the designs received.
Designs MUST contain approved strings.
    ```js
   import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
   
   const { t } = useTranslation();
   t('help_phone_number', 'Please call this number');
   ```

1. During the merge into `beta` branch the strings will be extracted by a [babel plugin][4] and pushed into the
dedicated repository.

1. Translators will translate the strings on the translation platform.

1. During the merge into `release` branch the strings will be pulled from the dedicated repository and committed
for the build. The commit will be also sent to the `devel` branch.
